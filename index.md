# Welcome to twig {{version}}

## description

<font size=4>
**twig** is an agent that enables people to get access to twitter freely via gtalk.

The idea of gtalk-based twitter accessing was derived from **[twitalker](http://code.google.com/p/twitalker/)**, 
which partly gave birth to **twig** as well, thanks for twitalker!

## how to use

<font size=4>

1. [sign in with twitter](/oauth/sign)
2. add friend "`{{app_name}}@appspot.com`"
3. send message " `.help` " for a short instruction about how to play with it
4. most commands are similar with those in **twitalker**, EXCEPT that leading character of commands is '.' instead of '-'
5. use " `.cmds` " to grab available commands, " `.alias` " to find alias of a given command.
6. more detailed help document is [here](/help/commandhelp)
