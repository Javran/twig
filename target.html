<h1>Welcome to twig {{version}}</h1>
<h2>description</h2>
<p><font size=4>
<strong>twig</strong> is an agent that enables people to get access to twitter freely via gtalk.</p>
<p>The idea of gtalk-based twitter accessing was derived from <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/twitalker/">twitalker</a></strong>, 
which partly gave birth to <strong>twig</strong> as well, thanks for twitalker!</p>

<h2>how to use</h2>
<p><font size=4></p>

<li>add friend "<code>{{app_name}}@appspot.com</code>"</li>
<li>send message " <code>.help</code> " for a short instruction about how to play with it</li>
<li>most commands are similar with those in <strong>twitalker</strong>, EXCEPT that leading character of commands is '.' instead of '-'</li>
<li>use " <code>.cmds</code> " to grab available commands, " <code>.alias</code> " to find alias of a given command.</li>
